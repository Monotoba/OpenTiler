# OpenTiler Future Upgrades

## Overview

This document outlines planned future enhancements for OpenTiler, including multi-page PDF handling, advanced features, and long-term roadmap items.

## Version 1.1 - Multi-Page PDF Support

### Multi-Page PDF Input Handling
**Priority**: High  
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 2-3 months

#### Current Limitation
OpenTiler currently loads only the first page of multi-page PDF documents.

#### Proposed Solution
1. **Page Selection Interface**
   - Add page navigation controls to document viewer
   - Thumbnail strip showing all pages
   - Page selector dropdown for quick navigation
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Page Up/Down, Ctrl+G for "Go to page")

2. **Individual Page Processing**
   - Scale and tile each page independently
   - Maintain separate scale factors per page if needed
   - Export each page as separate tile set
   - Combined export option for all pages

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Process all pages with same scale factor
   - Bulk export with page numbering
   - Progress indicator for multi-page operations

#### Implementation Details
```python
class MultiPageDocument:
    def __init__(self, pdf_path: str):
        self.pages: List[QPixmap] = []
        self.current_page: int = 0
        self.scale_factors: Dict[int, float] = {}
    
    def load_page(self, page_num: int) -> QPixmap:
        """Load specific page from PDF."""
        
    def export_all_pages(self, settings: ExportSettings):
        """Export all pages with consistent settings."""
```

#### User Interface Changes
- Page navigation toolbar
- Page thumbnail panel (collapsible)
- Page-specific settings in export dialog
- Batch processing options

## Version 1.2 - Advanced Measurement Tools

### Enhanced Scaling Features
**Priority**: Medium
