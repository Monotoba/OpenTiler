## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-04

### Added
- Contributor guide: `AGENTS.md` with project structure, commands, style, testing, and PR conventions.
- Utilities for tiling: `compute_page_grid_with_gutters`, `compute_page_size_pixels`, and `summarize_page_grid` in `opentiler/utils/helpers.py`.

### Changed
- Viewer overlay: removed red page-edge boundary drawing in the main document viewer; only gutter/crop/registration/page indicators remain.
- Metadata page: removed red page boundaries from the tilemap and legend; shows gutter/printable area and page numbers only.
- Centralized tile slicing: `MainWindow.on_scale_applied` now uses helper `compute_page_grid_with_gutters`; legacy `_calculate_page_grid_with_gutters` now delegates (kept for compatibility).
- Consistent tile counts: `summarize_page_grid` used in preview panel, PDF exporter, and print metadata to compute `tiles_x/tiles_y/total_tiles`.
- Unified tile layout math: preview thumbnails and printed tiles now share `compute_tile_layout` for source/destination/printable rect calculations, ensuring matching on-screen and printed results.
- Exporters aligned: Image and PDF exporters now use `compute_tile_layout` to render each page, eliminating duplicate logic and aligning exported output with preview/print layout.
- Printing fix: Gutter offsets for physical printers are now computed from the printable area (px/mm derived from `QPageLayout.paintRectPixels`) to avoid content clipping at the top/right due to hardware margins and driver differences.
 - Printing fix (refined): Use printable area in millimeters (`QPageLayout.paintRect(QPageLayout.Millimeter)`) to derive per‑axis px/mm from the paint rect, ensuring precise mapping for both PDF and physical printers.

### Notes
- No functional changes to scale/datum overlays or printing logic, except visual removal of red page-edge lines as noted above.

### Changed
- **UI Layout**: Expanded preview panel from 30% to 40% width
- **Preview Height**: Doubled minimum height from 200px to 400px
- **Toolbar Icons**: Replaced text with professional standard icons
- **Export Dialog**: Enhanced with accurate page counts and format options
- **PDF Export**: Complete rewrite with professional quality output
- **Settings Dialog**: Added DPI selection and enhanced options

### Fixed
- **PDF Export Errors**: Fixed QPdfWriter API compatibility issues
- **Page Count Display**: Accurate counting including metadata pages
- **Image Scaling**: Fixed QPixmap.scaled() parameter errors
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and error handling
- **File Format Detection**: Robust format detection and loading
- **Export Pipeline**: Complete export workflow with error recovery

### Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive file format validation
- **Error Handling**: Safe error handling prevents crashes
- **Memory Safety**: Proper resource management and cleanup

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-XX (Development)
