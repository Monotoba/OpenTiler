# Tools Overview

## Scaling Tool
Define real-world scale using two points and a known distance. Generates a scale factor (mm per pixel) used for tiling and printing.

Tips:
- Zoom in for precise point selection.
- Use known distances on the drawing (e.g., 1000 mm).

## Measure Tool
Measure distances in the document at the current scale. Useful to verify scaling and dimensions.

## Unit Converter
Convert values between mm, inches, and pixels. Handy for checking DPI-related measurements.

## Scale Calculator
Compute scale ratios (e.g., 1:50, 1:100) or convert between ratio and mm-per-pixel.

## Printer Calibration
Set safety insets (right/bottom) to prevent clipping. Configure separately for portrait and landscape.

Open from: Tools → Printer Calibration… or see [Printing & Calibration](printing_and_calibration.md).
