# Troubleshooting

## No document visible after open
- Confirm format is supported.
- Check logs in console.

## Export says no tiles/grid
- Run Scaling Tool and confirm a page grid appears in the Preview Panel.

## Printed output mis-sized
- Re-run scaling with precise points.
- Verify printer calibration (right/bottom insets).

## Slow rendering on large files
- Use optimized images/pdf.
- Close other heavy apps.
