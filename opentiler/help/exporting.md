# Exporting Tiles

Use File → Export Tiles… to export to PDF or images.

## Requirements
- A document is loaded and scaled.
- A page grid exists (created after scaling with your preferred page size).

## PDF Export
- Multi-page PDF: one tile per page.
- Composite PDF: when supported, combine tiles into a layout.
- Include overlays: optionally print crop marks, scale bar, and metadata.

## Image Export
- Export each tile as a separate image file.

## Tips
- Verify scale using the Measure Tool before exporting.
- Use print preview first to confirm layout and orientation.
