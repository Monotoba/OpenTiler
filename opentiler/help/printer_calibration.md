# Printer Calibration Help

Use safety insets to avoid right/bottom clipping caused by printer margins.

Steps:
1. Open Tools → Printer Calibration…
2. Print ladder/debug sheets in both orientations.
3. Enter the largest visible tick (mm) as right/bottom measured values.
4. Apply to set the calibration fields; add a small extra if needed.
5. Save settings, then use Print Preview to verify.
