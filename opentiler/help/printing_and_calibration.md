# Printing & Calibration

## Print Preview
Open File → Print Preview… to see how tiles render on a printer. Uses current page size, orientation, gutters, overlays, and calibration settings.

## Print Tiles
File → Print Tiles… sends tiles directly to your printer.

## Calibration
Some printers clip near the right/bottom edges. Use Tools → Printer Calibration… to apply safety insets (mm) that reduce the printable area to avoid clipping.

- Portrait and Landscape are calibrated separately.
- Ladder/debug sheets can be printed to measure safe margins.

## Overlays
- Crop marks and gutter rectangles help assembly.
- Scale bar can be rendered at true physical length using printer DPI.
